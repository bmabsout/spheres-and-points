(1) Result lines that only contain the string "<BLANKLINE>" are interpreted as
    empty lines.  Consequently we can not test expressions that evaluates to
    "<BLANKLINE>".  Let me know if you really need this feature, and we will
    work something out.

(2) Lines that start with ">>>" introduce a new expression.  Consequently we
    can not test expressions that evaluate to something that starts with ">>>".
    Again, let me know if you really need this, and we will probably work
    something out.
 
(3) Currently we do not care whether the output produced by an expression is
    terminated with a newline or not.  So both of the following examples will
    pass:

    >>> putStr "foo"
    foo

    >>> putStrLn "foo"
    foo
